## Installation

Chrome 93 is the minimum supported version; use a current stable browser. Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nycu-e3-helper/cmagonljljocpkfojkabhiedjafamoef), or load the source in Chrome, Edge or Brave:

1. Clone this repository or download its source.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`, `edge://extensions/` or `brave://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**, select **Load unpacked**, and choose the folder containing `manifest.json`.
4. Open an E3 webpage and click the floating **E3 Helper** button.

After updating the source, reload the extension and refresh open webpages. Fresh installs automatically load the sidebar on https://e3.nycu.edu.tw/, https://e3p.nycu.edu.tw/ https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/ and https://portal.nycu.edu.tw/ without changing browser site access settings; other websites and tabs do not load the sidebar unless you opt into the all-websites floating button.

## Getting started and language

1. Sign in to [E3](https://e3p.nycu.edu.tw/).
2. Open the sidebar and click **Sync** to load assignments and courses.
3. Use **Assignments**, **Courses**, **Downloads**, **Announcements**, **Alerts** and **Help** to navigate. The tabs wrap onto additional rows when the sidebar is narrow, keeping every label visible.

The initial interface language follows your browser: Chinese uses Traditional Chinese; other languages use English. To change it, open **More (⋯) → Settings → Interface language**, select **English** or **繁體中文**, and click **Save settings**. Saving a new language refreshes the current page. Refresh other open pages manually.

Your language choice is stored locally. Course names, assignment names and original announcement/message content keep their source text. New AI summaries and daily digests use the selected interface language. Previously saved notifications and release notes may retain the language in which they were created.

Appearance is light by default. To change it, open **More (⋯) → Settings → Appearance → Theme**, choose **Dark** or **Follow system**, and click **Save settings**; the change applies immediately. Announcement and message previews stay on a light background in the dark theme so their original colors remain readable.

## Daily use

### Assignments

Click a card to open its assignment page. Use **Mark as submitted** to change the status, or **Submitted** to mark it as pending again. Use **Add assignment**, **Edit** and **Delete** to manage custom assignments.

Deadlines use your local time zone. Countdowns are red with less than one hour remaining, amber with less than 24 hours remaining, normal otherwise, and gray after the deadline. Submitted assignments are hidden from the list after their deadline. Deleted E3 assignments can reappear after syncing.

### Announcements and messages

Open **Announcements** to load data, or click **Reload**. Filter by type and read status. A red dot indicates an unread item. **View content** opens a preview with read-status controls and **Open full page**.

Use **Chinese → English**, **English → Chinese**, **AI summary** or **Show original** in the preview. Translation uses Google Translate and requires no OpenAI API key.

### Today's digest

Load announcements and messages, then click **Generate digest** at the top of the Announcements tab. Enable AI summaries, select Gemini or OpenAI, and save the selected provider’s API key and model in Settings first.

The digest uses today's local date and up to 40 recent items, regardless of filters. It summarizes titles, courses, senders and timestamps, rather than reading each item's full body. Open the source links for full instructions and deadlines. Successful digests are cached locally; a failed regeneration preserves the previous result.

### Courses and downloads

Sync courses, select a course in **Courses**, and open **Statistics** or **Grades**. Loading data requires an active E3 login.

In **Downloads**, use **Scan this page** on an E3 page, or **Select courses** to scan selected courses. Select the files, then choose **Download separately** or **Download ZIP**. Documents, videos and archives are supported. For large files, use smaller batches or download from the source page.

### Notifications and synchronization

**Alerts** collects assignment, grading, announcement, membership and version notifications. Assignments due within 24 hours also contribute to reminders.

Open **More → Settings → Configure notifications and reminders**, or the extension options page, to configure desktop delivery, announcement/message updates, immediate or daily delivery, a local daily time, and multiple deadline reminder offsets. Remove all offsets to disable deadline reminders. Click **Save settings** to apply changes; **Test notification** checks desktop delivery.

The first announcement/message snapshot establishes a silent baseline. Daily mode delivers pending events separately at the selected time. Submitted, deleted, changed and expired assignment deadlines are skipped. After sleep, only the nearest elapsed reminder threshold is queued. The engine processes its queue every minute while the browser is running, so sleep may delay delivery. Allow notifications in both browser and system settings. Sidebar alerts remain available when desktop delivery is disabled or unsupported. See [Notification preferences](docs/features/notification-preferences.md).

Background sync runs every 60 minutes for assignments, courses and membership checks, and every 30 minutes for announcements and messages. The open sidebar also checks for stale assignment/course data. Manual **Sync** updates assignments and courses; use **Reload** in Announcements for announcements and messages.

The helper displays its sidebar on the two E3 hosts, timetable and portal by default. E3 data collection stays on E3. Scheduled announcement and message synchronization only uses existing E3 tabs and skips when none are open. Manual loading may briefly create an inactive E3 tab and close it afterward. Scanning the current page requires opening the relevant E3 page.

## AI settings and privacy

Open **More → Settings**, enable AI summaries, select **Gemini** or **OpenAI**, enter that provider’s API key, choose a model and click **Save settings**. Both providers’ settings are retained when you switch. Gemini models load from the API when Gemini is active; you can reload the list or enter a model ID manually. Select a model explicitly before generating a summary. **Test connection** checks the selected provider. Account access, pricing and quotas depend on your provider account.

Course data, read status, settings and API keys are stored locally in your browser. Translation sends content to Google Translate. Individual summaries send the item body to the selected Gemini or OpenAI provider; daily digests send today's titles, courses, senders and timestamps. OpenAI summary requests use the Responses API with `store: false`. The extension uses your existing E3 login and does not ask for your E3 password.

Source content may contain names or other personal information; check that it is appropriate to send to a third party before using translation or AI. Provider data handling follows each service's policies. AI can be disabled while other features remain available. See [Summaries and daily digest](docs/features/openai-digest.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **Sync or loading fails:** sign in to E3 again, check your connection and retry.
- **AI summary fails:** check that summaries are enabled and your API key is saved; test the connection in Settings.
- **Translation fails:** check your connection and retry. Translation does not require an AI provider key.
- **The interface is outdated after an update:** reload the extension, then refresh open webpages.
- **ZIP download fails:** retry with fewer files or use individual downloads.
- **Desktop alerts do not appear:** save notification settings, check browser/system permissions and use Test notification.
- **Need to report a problem:** use **More → View logs** or **More → Report an issue**. Review logs for personal information before sharing.

## Development

`content.js` implements the sidebar and E3 interaction. `background.js` handles downloads, background synchronization and API calls. `i18n.js` contains the shared interface catalog, language preference and static-template translation. `_locales/` supplies localized extension descriptions. `notification-engine.js` schedules desktop alerts, and `notification-settings.html` is the standalone settings page.

Translations apply to source-authored text before dynamic values are interpolated, preserving course names, URLs and original content. Keep E3 scraping selectors and parsing rules separate from translated UI text. Downloads and content requests require exact HTTPS E3 hosts, including final redirect validation. Preview HTML sanitization removes dangerous tags, event attributes and URLs.

Run unit tests and syntax checks with:

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
node --check i18n.js
node --check content.js
node --check background.js
node --check notification-engine.js
```

Optional browser smoke test (requires Playwright and a browser):

```bash
node tests/ui-smoke.cjs
node tests/language-ui-smoke.cjs
node tests/translation-html-smoke.cjs
node tests/notification-ui-smoke.cjs
node tests/notification-extension-smoke.cjs
```

Set `CHROME_PATH` to use an existing Chrome executable, or `PLAYWRIGHT_PATH` to use a Playwright installation outside this project. The UI fixtures use local data and do not contact E3 or an AI service. The real extension notification fixture requires Playwright Chromium and uses an isolated profile with external DNS blocked.

Implementation guides: [Appearance](docs/features/ui-appearance.md), [AI summaries](docs/features/openai-digest.md), [English interface](docs/features/english-interface.md), [Notifications](docs/features/notification-preferences.md).

### Floating button on all websites (Chrome 96+)

Off by default. Go to More → Settings → Open website display settings, then enable “Show the floating button on all websites” on the extension options page. This switch saves immediately and requests optional HTTP/HTTPS site access when first enabled. Declining access leaves it off. Google and other ordinary websites can then show the sidebar with cached assignments and due-date countdowns, without automatically opening E3. Updating assignments still requires E3 login and sync. Other sites receive only a CSS-isolated 46px launcher. Clicking creates an extension-origin iframe; coursework and API keys stay outside the host page DOM. Turning the option off destroys the launcher and private frame, stops future injection, and revokes broad optional host access; the default campus sites remain available. Chrome internal pages and the Chrome Web Store are restricted.
